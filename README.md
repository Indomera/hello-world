# hello-world
My first GitHub project of many!

I have started the long road of becoming a web developer and master programmer...all on my own!

Career changes aren't easy but where there is a will there is a way!

I plan to secure a junior web developer job in the near future, then start an MBA in IT management.  The end goal is to own my own tech company within 10 to 15 years or less.
